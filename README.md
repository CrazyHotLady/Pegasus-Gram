Pegasus-Gram is a Python-based advanced keylogger and cyber surveillance tool integrated with Telegram. It is designed for ethical hacking simulations, red team operations, and authorized cybersecurity audits. The tool captures a wide range of system activities and forwards them to a configured Telegram bot in real-time.

## ✨ Core Features

- ✅ **Keystroke Logging** – Captures all typed characters with timestamps and window titles.
- ✅ **Clipboard Monitoring** – Detects and sends changes to the system clipboard.
- ✅ **Scheduled Screenshots** – Takes periodic screenshots of the full screen or active window.
- ✅ **Webcam Image Capture** – Takes photos using the webcam on schedule.
- ✅ **Audio Recording** – Records ambient sounds via microphone (e.g., 10 sec or 1 min).
- ✅ **Window Focus Logger** – Tracks changes in the focused application.
- ✅ **File Activity Tracker** – Monitors file creation, deletion, and modification.
- ✅ **Wi-Fi & Network Info Logger** – Retrieves IP address, SSID, and geolocation via public APIs.
- ✅ **Remote Command Executor** – Executes commands sent through Telegram.
- ✅ **Anomaly Detection (AI)** – Detects abnormal behavior such as rapid typing or silent periods.
- ✅ **Anti-Tampering Watchdog** – Restarts the app if closed or killed.
- ✅ **Offline HTML Reporting** – Generates reports with all logs and activity for offline analysis.
- ✅ **Encrypted Configuration** – Encrypts bot token and chat ID using base64 or AES.
- ✅ **Error Logging** – Logs exceptions and crashes into `errors_log.txt`.
- ✅ **Modular Asynchronous Design** – Each function runs in its own asyncio coroutine.

## 🧠 Additional Bonus Features

- 🔐 **Key Obfuscation** – Obfuscates keystrokes in memory to avoid detection by anti-keylogger tools.
- 🕸️ **Browser History Logger** – Retrieves visited URLs from common browsers (Chrome, Firefox).
- 📎 **USB Device Tracker** – Detects USB plug/unplug events.
- 🧪 **Process Monitor** – Logs running processes and detects suspicious binaries.
- 📸 **Active Window Screenshot** – Screenshots only the currently focused window.
- 📤 **Auto Upload to Cloud (Optional)** – Can sync logs to Dropbox/Google Drive.
- 🛠️ **Telegram Admin Control Panel** – Telegram bot offers menu to enable/disable modules.
- 🧰 **Persistence Installer** – Adds tool to startup (Windows/Linux service).
- 📅 **Activity Timeline Generator** – Creates a full activity timeline from captured data.
- 🧠 **User Behavior Profiler** – Profiles typing speed, clipboard frequency, focus time.
- 🕵️ **Hidden Mode** – Can hide console or app window completely from taskbar.
- ⚙️ **Auto Update Checker** – Pings GitHub repo or server to check for script updates.
- 🧮 **Compression & Batching** – Batches multiple logs before sending to reduce Telegram spam.
- 🧾 **Full Log Backup** – Maintains local encrypted backups of all logs in case Telegram fails.
- 🧪 **Sandbox Evasion** – Delays execution if it detects VM/sandbox to avoid honeypots.
